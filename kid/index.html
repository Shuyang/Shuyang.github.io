# Vibe-coding Fun with my kid!

I have been vide-coding with my 6-year-old. Both of us have a lot of fun! Here are some of the projects we have done together:
Games are in Chinese. Click to play now! 

* [ü¶Ä Crab Game](crab/)
  * Catch as many crabs as you can in 60 seconds!
  * Be careful! Don't touch the crawls (or the game ends)! 
  * Your bag can only hold only 30 crabs (or the game ends)!


* [‚úñÔ∏è Multiplication Game](multiplication_game/)
  * Solve as many multiplication problems as you can in 60 seconds!
  * Practice multiplication in a fun way!
